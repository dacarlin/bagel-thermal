# How to build fits and plots for all data

There are two types of data here, data on kinetics, and data on thermal stabiliy. 

## Raw data 

Raw data consists of rates `dP/dt` and is in a folder called `raw`. Within that directory, kinetics data is in the file `kinetics.csv`, and thermal stability data is in `thermal.csv`. 

The notebook `raw_data_cleanup.ipynb`, in the same directory, is used to pre-process the raw data.
